# Introduction

This project is a sorting algorithm visualization tool that helps you understand and compare various sorting algorithms by visually demonstrating how they work. Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and are used to rearrange elements in a list or array into a specific order.

Understanding how different sorting algorithms operate is crucial for programmers and computer scientists. This tool provides an interactive and educational way to explore and learn about these algorithms.
